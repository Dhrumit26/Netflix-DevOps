# 🎬 Netflix Clone - DevSecOps Cloud Project

This project demonstrates a fully integrated **DevSecOps pipeline** to build, secure, deploy, and monitor a Netflix clone application on **AWS EC2 and Kubernetes**. It combines the power of **CI/CD, Container Security, GitOps, and Observability**, showing how a modern software delivery pipeline should function in production.

## 🧠 What I Built

This project showcases how to build a production-grade, cloud-native Netflix clone using DevSecOps principles. I handled everything from provisioning infrastructure to deploying containers, securing the codebase, enabling automated CI/CD, implementing monitoring, and achieving GitOps delivery.  

This was not just a deployment task — it reflects:
- **Cloud knowledge (AWS EC2, Kubernetes, Helm)**
- **Security-first engineering (SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP scans)**
- **Infrastructure automation (Jenkins pipeline scripting, Docker image handling)**
- **Observability (Prometheus + Grafana dashboards, alert readiness)**
- **GitOps (ArgoCD syncing deployments from GitHub)**

## 📊 DevSecOps Architecture

<p align="center">

</p>

**Breakdown**:
- Jenkins pulls source code from GitHub and triggers a full CI/CD flow.
- Code quality and security is scanned with SonarQube and OWASP tools.
- Docker images are built, scanned with Trivy, and pushed to DockerHub.
- Helm deploys the app to a Kubernetes cluster.
- ArgoCD automatically syncs GitHub state to live K8s deployment.
- Prometheus + Grafana monitor metrics and display real-time dashboards.

## 🔍 Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- Multi-stage declarative pipeline using `Jenkinsfile`
- Integrates GitHub repo + Docker build + DockerHub push
- Static and dynamic security scanning embedded
- Pipeline breaks on failed quality gates or vulnerability reports

### ✅ Security Integration
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis and maintainability checks
- **Trivy**: Docker image scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Node.js vulnerability scanning
- Breaks the pipeline if vulnerabilities are detected

### ✅ GitOps with ArgoCD
- Auto-sync Kubernetes deployments from GitHub using ArgoCD
- Source of truth maintained in version control
- Easy rollback and re-deploy from Git interface

### ✅ Kubernetes Deployment
- Dockerized app deployed via Helm chart
- Configured NodePort and service monitoring
- Full deployment lifecycle visible in ArgoCD UI

### ✅ Monitoring & Observability
- Node Exporter + Prometheus collect system and container metrics
- Grafana visualizes Jenkins metrics, app usage, and system health
- Configurable dashboards + alerting support

### ✅ Cloud Infrastructure
- EC2 instance hosting all components in a secured environment
- Custom security groups, firewall rules, and port exposures
- Cost-effective single-node demonstration setup
